# Shadow Dancer Music Video

A music video/lyric visualizer for the song ["Shadow Dancer" by Robin and the Goblins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25Xaibsg15M).
The images were created with the Midjourney AI and edited using Davinci Resolve. 

I was inspired by for this project by the works of [Tree Jesus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIRKiCXT0gM) and [Ben Gillin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5i-hL7eHHQ). 

## Goals
* Dark romantic aesthetic
* Discernable storyline
* Absence of the common pitfalls of AI generated images, such as
  * overly messy or detailed backgrounds and textures
  * mangled body parts, especially hands, unless desired
* Illusion of stop motion animation 

## Ethical Considerations
